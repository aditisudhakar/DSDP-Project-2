## Can We Predict Loneliness?

Loneliness has emerged as a pressing societal concern in the wake of the Coronavirus pandemic and the ensuing surge in social distancing measures. The Community Life Survey highlighted that nearly 80% of respondents experienced varying degrees of loneliness, with approximately 4 million individuals frequently grappling with the debilitating effects of poor mental health. Compounded by strained mental health services, there's an urgent need to address this issue comprehensively.

Collaborating with the Bradford Institute for Health Research (BIHR), this project aims to explore the antecedents of loneliness and associated symptoms to better understand how to mitigate and predict loneliness. The team initially intended to use the the Connected Yorkshire Research Database, which encompasses anonymised electronic patient care data and self-reports on loneliness, but due to delays in data access, used the Understanding America Study (UAS) dataset instead. The research aims to investigate correlations between loneliness and physical or psychological symptoms, laying the groundwork for future agent-based modelling studies to examine the spread of loneliness across society.

By gaining deeper insights into loneliness characteristics, it aims to propose effective coping strategies for policymakers and marketers alike. Additionally, the findings will furnish practical health insights for Yorkshire's policymakers, facilitated by collaborations with Connected Yorkshire, BTHFT, NHS Trusts in Bradford and local authorities. Ultimately, this research endeavours to empower individuals struggling with loneliness by offering tailored coping mechanisms, enhancing their resilience, and enriching their overall well-being. The study aspires to contribute meaningfully to the mental health landscape in a post-pandemic world by addressing loneliness at its root and fostering stronger social connections.

## Data: 
The dataset is from the COVID-19 Panel dataset of the Understanding America Survey (UAS) AND can be access from https://uasdata.usc.edu/index.php upon request.

## Files:
The project is split into two files: the initial analysis is in Python followed by the modelling in STATA.
